## Why is this a paid plugin?

Something that is free has little or no perceived value. Users do not commit to free products and only use them until
something else looks nice and is free comes along. When I invest my time in the development of a new plugin I commit to
supporting and maintaining it. I ask my customers to do the same. I do not make money from this plugin by
advertisements, upgrades or additional services like hosting or setup.

Did you know that 30% of your purchase or donation goes to help fund the October Project?

My plugins take many hours to develop (40-120+) and even more hours to document and maintain. My paid plugins have to
pay for both this time, and the time I am spending on free plugins and less successful paid plugins. This means that it
will take even a successful plugin years to become profitable. Please consider buying an extended license if you want me
to continue to maintain these plugins for the very small fee I ask in return or hire me for adding functionality that
you feel is missing but valuable.

# Documentation

## Usage

After installation plugin will register backend **Form Builder** menu position. From there you will be able to manage
your forms.

There will be three sub-menus, Forms, Field types and Form logs.

Forms list all created forms.

Field types list all available field types.

Form logs list all forms submissions.

There will be two example forms included after installation. Simple contact form and default form, that will demonstrate
all available fields.

Plugin will register `renderForm` component to use it on CMS page. After adding component to CMS page, you must inspect
it (by clicking on it) and choose the form.

Plugin uses Ajax Framework to process form. Remember to add following code in layout:

```
{% framework extras %}
{% scripts %}
```

Please check if you have a following code in your layout `<head>` section.

```
{% styles %}
```

### Example of placing form component on CMS page

`/themes/demo/pages/contact.htm`

```
url = "/contact"
layout = "default"

[renderForm contactForm]
formCode = "contact-form"
==
{% component 'contactForm' %}
```

### Example of placing form component on CMS partial

`/themes/demo/pages/contact.htm`

```
url = "/contact"
layout = "default"

[renderForm contactForm]
formCode = "contact-form"
==
{% ajaxPartial "contact" %}
```

`/themes/demo/partials/contact.htm`

```
{% component 'contactForm' %}
```

> **Important note:** For form handler to work you must use `{% ajaxPartial %}` instead of normal partial
> tag `{% partial %}`.

## Forms

### Spam Protection

If you need Spam protection for your forms I recommend to install following
plugin: [Spam Protection Plugin](https://octobercms.com/plugin/renatio-spamprotection)

After you install this plugin it will automatically protect all your forms. It will work out of the box.

### Custom template

By default, the plugin will automatically generate the template when the **Custom Template** field is empty. If you want to replace the default markup generated by the plugin, you can write your own template here. You have access to special `form_field()` function which takes one parameter: the name of the field.

Example that will display two fields in one row:

```
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-6">{{ form_field('first_name') }}</div>
    <div class="col-6">{{ form_field('last_name') }}</div>
</div>
```

### Floating labels

Simple form labels that float over your input fields. This requires to use Bootstrap 5.

## Fields

### Custom HTML markup for fields

You can change HTML markup for each field by going to Form Builder -> Field types and updating the field type.
Recommended approach is to duplicate field type and then modify it as you wish.

### Custom field types

You can create custom field types by going to Form Builder -> Field types and clicking **New field type** button.

For example if you want to create **Email** field type just duplicate the markup from **Text** field type and change the
type of the input from text to email.

Now after saving this field it will be possible to use it in your form.

In markup section you can use Twig and following variables:

 Property          | Type   | Description
-------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------
 label             | String | Label for the field.
 field_id          | String | Unique field ID useful when pairing labels with inputs.
 label_class       | String | Label CSS classes.
 name              | String | HTML name attribute. Also used in mail template.
 default           | String | Default value for the field.
 comment           | String | Help block for the field.
 class             | String | HTML class.
 wrapper_class     | String | HTML wrapper class.
 placeholder       | String | Placeholder for the field.
 options           | Array  | Options for dropdown, radio list, checkbox list.
 custom_attributes | String | Custom HTML attributes. For example id="my-field".

Next go to Settings -> Form Builder -> Google reCaptcha and fill your site key and secret.

> **Important note:** This field must have **g-recaptcha-response** as field name and **required|recaptcha** in
> validation section to work properly.

#### Files upload

Renders a file input.

##### Filter files selected by a user

To filter allowed file extensions or file types you can add custom attribute.

For example to only allow selecting files with extension .pdf or .doc.

```
accept=".pdf,.doc"
```

For example to only allow selecting images:

```
accept="image/*"
```

##### Validation

To make file input required just add `required` in validation section.

To restrict max file size to 512 kb just add `max:512` in validation section.

To restrict file mime type to pdfs just add `mimes:pdf` in validation section.

To restrict file to images just add `image` in validation section.

For more available validation rules see October documentation.

##### Multiple files

By default, the file upload field allows uploading only a single file. To enable multiple file uploads in `Upload options` tab
check `Allow multiple files` checkbox.

When validating multiple files to work correctly you must check `Nested array based form input` checkbox in validation
section. This will apply validation for each uploaded file. Do not check this checkbox when using `required` rule.

##### Send uploaded files as mail attachments

By default uploaded files are sent with mail as attachments. You can disable this behavior by unchecking the checkbox.

##### Display mode

Display mode informs the backend how uploaded files should be displayed within a form submission entry. If you only allow to upload
images then select `image` mode.

> **Important note:** You must install [Location Plugin](https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-location) to use this
> field.

> **Important note:** You must install [Location Plugin](https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-location) to use this
> field.

#### Section

Renders a section heading and subheading. Useful for grouping fields.

#### Submit

Renders form submit button.

## Using form data in mail templates

When sending emails, all submitted form data is available directly in the mail template.

If your form contains a field named **name**, you can output its processed value simply by using:

```
{{ name }}
```

This value is already transformed by Form Builder.

For example:

- dropdown fields return the **label** of the selected option,
- checkbox lists return a readable value,
- formatting is normalized.

If you need access to the **raw submitted value** (exactly what the browser sent, before Form Builder processes it), use:

```
{{ name_raw }}
```

Every field automatically exposes a `{{ fieldname_raw }}` variable.

## Form Submissions

Form Builder plugin has built-in functionality for storing submitted form data. Each submission record contains the user's input and any file attachments.

## Events

Plugin will fire **formBuilder.overrideForm** event which allow to change form properties before rendering the form
markup.

```
Event::listen('formBuilder.overrideForm', function ($form) {
    // example code
    $form->css_class = 'form-horizontal';
});
```

Plugin will fire **formBuilder.overrideField** event which allow to change field properties before rendering the form
markup.

```
Event::listen('formBuilder.overrideField', function ($field, $form) {
    // example code
    if ($field->name === 'currency') {
        $field->default = 'USD';
    }
});
```

Plugin will fire **formBuilder.extendFormData** event which allow to change submitted form data.

```
Event::listen('formBuilder.extendFormData', function ($data) {
    // example code
    $data['foo'] = 'bar';

    return $data; // this line is required
});
```

Plugin will fire **formBuilder.beforeSendMessage** event before sending email. You can use this to extend Form Builder
default functionality.

In your extension plugin boot method listen for this event:

```
Event::listen('formBuilder.beforeSendMessage', function ($form, $data) {
    // example code
    $form->from_email = 'john.doe@exampl.com';
    $form->from_name = 'John Doe';
});
```

You will have access to form object and array with posted data.

If you return **false** from this event then this will stop default behavior of sending email message.
